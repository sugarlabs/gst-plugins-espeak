Before committing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All source files need to be passed through indent command.
Follow http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activity_Team/Sugar_Lint instructions
and especially "Lint files before committing" section.
Otherwise just call indent command with settings [1].


Send patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create your patches using "git format" command and send them to all maintainers
from AUTHORS file. The easiest way it just using "git send-email" command.
